# Chapter 2: Financial Planning

## Money and Homesteading: A Real Talk

Let's talk about money. I know—it's not the most comfortable topic, especially when you're dreaming about a lifestyle that feels like it should be simpler and freer. But here's the thing: understanding your finances isn't about limiting your dreams. It's about making them achievable.

Many people have complicated feelings about money. Maybe you feel like you don't have enough, or you're embarrassed about debt, or you're worried that focusing on money will make you lose sight of what really matters. I get it. But financial planning for homesteading isn't about becoming wealthy or following someone else's rules. It's about understanding where you are so you can get where you want to go.

Think of it this way: if you were planning a road trip, you'd want to know how much gas you have, right? You'd want to know if you need to fill up before you leave, or if you can make it to your destination. Financial planning is the same thing—it's just checking your fuel gauge before you start the journey.

## Why Financial Planning is Empowering

Here's what I want you to understand: knowing your financial situation gives you power. When you know where you stand, you can make informed decisions. You can create a realistic timeline. You can avoid surprises that derail your plans. You can move forward with confidence instead of anxiety.

Financial planning isn't about restriction—it's about clarity. It's about knowing what's possible and when, so you can make choices that align with your vision and your reality.

Let's start by understanding where you are right now. Not where you wish you were, or where you think you should be, but where you actually are. This is your starting point, and that's okay. Everyone starts somewhere.

## Understanding Your Current Situation

Before we can plan where we're going, we need to know where we are. This might feel uncomfortable, especially if money is a source of stress in your life. But remember: we're just gathering information. There's no judgment here—just facts.

Let's start with a simple question: How do you feel about your current financial situation?

Take a moment and really think about this. Are you feeling confident? Anxious? Overwhelmed? Hopeful? All of the above? Your feelings are valid, and they're information. They tell us something about your relationship with money and what might need attention.

### Exercise: Your Money Relationship

Before we dive into numbers, let's explore your relationship with money. This might seem unrelated to homesteading, but how you think about money will affect every financial decision you make.

**Reflection Questions:**
1. What messages did you receive about money growing up? (Write a few sentences)
Answer: I was taught that, "the love of money is the root of all evil". This has caused me to have a negative outlook on money as any kind of want or desire to "make money" was viewed as a character flaw and wrong. I now value what money can provide, but I still don't have much of a drive to make a lot of money or become "rich".

2. How do you feel when you think about your finances? (Be honest)
Answer: I feel pretty good over all. I own a home and have investment accounts and a 401k. I hope to not touch the 401k but use my current saving and on-going work salary to purchase and build out the homestead in the first year.

3. What's your biggest financial fear related to homesteading?
Answer: Running out of money or running into an unexpected expense that causes me to have great difficulty.

4. What would financial security look like to you?
Answer: Getting to the point where I don't have any debt and can live off of investments and social security when I'm a senior.

5. How do you want money to serve your homesteading vision?
Answer: Fuel the work and progress.


There are no right or wrong answers here. The goal is just to understand your starting point.

## Assessing Your Income

Now let's look at the numbers, but we'll do it step by step so it doesn't feel overwhelming.

First, let's understand your income. This includes everything that comes in regularly:
- Your primary job income
- Any side income or freelance work
- Investment income
- Any other regular income sources

### Exercise: Income Assessment

Take a moment and list all your income sources. Don't worry about being exact—estimates are fine for now.

**Monthly Income Sources:**
- Primary job: Approximately $__________ per month
- Side income/freelance: Approximately $__________ per month
- Other income: Approximately $__________ per month
- **Total Monthly Income:** Approximately $__________

**Annual Income:** Approximately $__________ per year

If you have irregular income (like freelance work that varies), estimate your average monthly income over the past year.

## Understanding Your Expenses

Now let's look at what goes out. This is often where people feel the most resistance, but remember: we're just gathering information. We're not judging your spending or telling you what to do.

Your expenses include everything you spend money on regularly:
- Housing (rent or mortgage)
- Utilities
- Food
- Transportation
- Insurance
- Debt payments
- Subscriptions
- Entertainment
- Everything else

### Exercise: Expense Assessment

This might take a little time, but it's worth doing. Look at your bank statements or receipts from the past few months and estimate your average monthly spending in each category.

**Monthly Expenses:**
- Housing (rent/mortgage): Approximately $__________
- Utilities: Approximately $__________
- Food: Approximately $__________
- Transportation: Approximately $__________
- Insurance: Approximately $__________
- Debt payments: Approximately $__________
- Subscriptions/services: Approximately $__________
- Entertainment/recreation: Approximately $__________
- Other expenses: Approximately $__________
- **Total Monthly Expenses:** Approximately $__________

**Monthly Surplus or Deficit:**
- Income: $__________
- Expenses: $__________
- **Difference:** $__________ (This is what you have left over each month, or what you're short)

If you're spending more than you're making, that's important information. It means we need to address that before we can plan for savings. If you have money left over, that's your potential savings capacity.

## Understanding Your Debt

Debt is a reality for many people, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. What matters is understanding it and having a plan. Let's look at what you owe.

### Exercise: Debt Assessment

List all your debts. Include credit cards, student loans, car loans, personal loans, or anything else you owe money on.

**Your Debts:**
- Credit cards: Approximately $__________ (Monthly payment: $__________)
- Student loans: Approximately $__________ (Monthly payment: $__________)
- Auto loan: Approximately $__________ (Monthly payment: $__________)
- Other loans: Approximately $__________ (Monthly payment: $__________)
- **Total Debt:** Approximately $__________
- **Total Monthly Debt Payments:** Approximately $__________

**Debt-to-Income Ratio:**
- Monthly debt payments: $__________
- Monthly income: $__________
- **Ratio:** _____% (Divide debt payments by income and multiply by 100)

A general guideline: if your debt payments are more than 30-40% of your income, you might want to focus on paying down debt before taking on new financial commitments. But this isn't a hard rule—it's just information to consider.

## Understanding Your Savings

Now let's look at what you have saved. This includes:
- Emergency fund
- Any savings specifically for homesteading
- Other savings or investments

### Exercise: Savings Assessment

**Current Savings:**
- Emergency fund: $__________
- Land/homestead fund: $__________
- Other savings: $__________
- **Total Savings:** $__________

If you don't have much saved yet, that's okay. We're going to create a plan. If you do have savings, that's great—it's a head start.

## Your Net Worth (Optional but Helpful)

Your net worth is simply what you own minus what you owe. It's a snapshot of your financial position.

**Assets (What You Own):**
- Savings: $__________
- Investments: $__________
- Property/vehicles: $__________
- Other assets: $__________
- **Total Assets:** $__________

**Liabilities (What You Owe):**
- Total debt: $__________
- Other liabilities: $__________
- **Total Liabilities:** $__________

**Net Worth:** $__________ (Assets minus Liabilities)

This number isn't good or bad—it's just information. It tells you where you're starting from.

## Setting Realistic Savings Goals

Now that you understand where you are, let's think about where you need to be. But here's the important part: we're going to be realistic. There's no point in setting goals you can't achieve—that just leads to frustration.

Let's think about what you'll need for your homestead. I'll give you some general ranges, but remember: these vary significantly based on location, your vision, and your choices.

### Land Acquisition Costs

For a small homestead (1/3 to 1/2 acre), you might be looking at:
- Land purchase: $15,000 - $25,000 (varies widely by location)
- Closing costs: $1,000 - $2,000
- Initial site assessment: $500 - $1,000
- **Total: Approximately $16,500 - $28,000**

But remember: land prices vary dramatically. In some areas, you might find land for less. In others, you'll pay more. We'll research specific areas later.

### Infrastructure Costs

This is where costs can really vary based on your choices. Here are some general ranges:

**Basic Setup (Minimal):**
- Site preparation: $500 - $2,000
- Temporary shelter (yurt or similar): $4,000 - $8,000
- Basic water system (rainwater): $600 - $1,200
- Basic solar system: $2,000 - $3,000
- Composting toilet: $500 - $2,000
- **Total: Approximately $7,600 - $16,200**

**More Comprehensive Setup:**
- Site preparation: $1,000 - $2,000
- Permanent shelter (cabin conversion): $10,000 - $15,000
- Well drilling: $5,000 - $15,000
- Larger solar system: $4,000 - $6,000
- Septic system: $5,000 - $10,000
- **Total: Approximately $25,000 - $48,000**

These are just estimates. Your actual costs will depend on your choices, your location, and your skills (doing work yourself saves money).

### Exercise: Your Savings Goals

Based on your vision and the estimates above, what do you think you'll need?

**Land Fund Goal:** $__________
- Land purchase: $__________
- Closing costs: $1,000 - $2,000
- Site assessment: $500 - $1,000
- **Total needed:** $__________

**Infrastructure Fund Goal:** $__________
- This depends on your choices, but plan for at least $10,000 - $20,000 for basics

**Emergency Fund Goal:** $__________
- I recommend $3,000 - $5,000 minimum, but more is better

**Total Savings Needed:** $__________

## Creating Your Savings Plan

Now let's figure out how to get there. This is where we get practical.

First, let's see what you can realistically save each month. Look back at your income and expenses. If you have money left over, that's your starting point. If you don't, we need to address that first.

### Exercise: Monthly Savings Capacity

**Your Situation:**
- Monthly income: $__________
- Monthly expenses: $__________
- **Current surplus/deficit:** $__________

If you have a surplus, that's great—that's money you can save. If you have a deficit, we need to either increase income or decrease expenses (or both) before you can save for homesteading.

**Potential Monthly Savings:**
- Current surplus: $__________
- Or, if you cut expenses: $__________
- Or, if you increase income: $__________
- **Realistic monthly savings goal:** $__________

### Exercise: Timeline Planning

Now let's figure out your timeline. How long will it take you to save what you need?

**Your Savings Goals:**
- Land fund: $__________
- Infrastructure fund: $__________
- Emergency fund: $__________
- **Total needed:** $__________

**Your Monthly Savings Capacity:** $__________

**Timeline Calculation:**
- Total needed: $__________
- Monthly savings: $__________
- **Months to save:** _____ (Divide total by monthly savings)
- **Years to save:** _____ (Divide months by 12)

Is this timeline realistic for you? If it feels too long, we might need to adjust either the goals (maybe start smaller) or the savings capacity (maybe there are ways to save more).

## Addressing Debt

If you have significant debt, you might be wondering: Should I pay off debt first, or save for homesteading?

There's no one right answer. It depends on your situation. Here are some things to consider:

**Pay Debt First If:**
- Your debt payments are a significant burden
- You have high-interest debt (credit cards, etc.)
- The debt is causing you stress
- You can't save while paying debt

**Save While Paying Debt If:**
- Your debt is manageable
- You have low-interest debt (like some student loans)
- You want to make progress on both goals
- You can do both without too much strain

### Exercise: Debt Strategy

Think about your debt situation. What feels right to you?

**My Approach:**
- [ ] Pay off debt completely before saving for homesteading
- [ ] Pay off high-interest debt, then save
- [ ] Save and pay debt simultaneously
- [ ] Other approach: _________________________________

**Reasoning:** _________________________________

Remember: there's no perfect answer. Choose the approach that feels sustainable for you.

## Building Your Savings

Once you know how much you can save and how long it will take, the key is consistency. Small amounts add up over time.

### Strategies to Accelerate Savings

If you want to save faster, here are some options:

**Reduce Expenses:**
- Cut subscriptions you don't use
- Cook at home more
- Reduce entertainment spending
- Downsize housing if possible
- Other ideas: _________________________________

**Increase Income:**
- Take on side work
- Sell unused items
- Ask for a raise
- Start a side business
- Other ideas: _________________________________

**Both:**
- The fastest way is usually doing both—reduce expenses and increase income

### Exercise: Savings Acceleration Plan

What are 2-3 things you could do to save more money?

1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

Be realistic. Don't commit to things you won't actually do. Small, sustainable changes are better than big changes you can't maintain.

## Monthly Budget Planning

Now let's create a simple monthly budget that supports your savings goals. This doesn't have to be complicated—just a plan for where your money goes.

### Exercise: Monthly Budget

**Monthly Income:** $__________

**Monthly Expenses:**
- Housing: $__________
- Utilities: $__________
- Food: $__________
- Transportation: $__________
- Insurance: $__________
- Debt payments: $__________
- Other necessities: $__________
- **Total Necessities:** $__________

**Discretionary Spending:**
- Entertainment: $__________
- Subscriptions: $__________
- Other: $__________
- **Total Discretionary:** $__________

**Savings:**
- Land fund: $__________
- Infrastructure fund: $__________
- Emergency fund: $__________
- **Total Savings:** $__________

**Total (should equal income):** $__________

If your total is more than your income, you need to adjust. If it's less, you have room to save more or spend more.

## Understanding Costs: A Reality Check

Let me give you some realistic cost ranges for common homestead expenses. These are based on typical scenarios, but remember: your costs will vary.

**Land:** $15,000 - $25,000 for small plots (1/3 to 1/2 acre), but can be much higher or lower depending on location

**Temporary Shelter:**
- Yurt: $4,000 - $8,000
- RV/Travel trailer: $5,000 - $30,000 (used)
- Small cabin conversion: $10,000 - $15,000

**Water Systems:**
- Rainwater catchment: $600 - $1,200
- Well drilling: $5,000 - $15,000 (varies by depth and location)

**Solar Power:**
- Basic system (1000W): $2,000 - $3,000
- Medium system (2000W): $4,000 - $6,000

**Waste Management:**
- Composting toilet: $500 - $2,000
- Septic system: $5,000 - $10,000

**Food Production:**
- Garden setup: $200 - $1,000
- Chicken coop: $300 - $800
- Greenhouse: $500 - $5,000

These are just estimates. Your actual costs will depend on your choices, your location, your skills, and whether you do work yourself or hire it out.

## Financial Milestones

Let's set some financial milestones to track your progress. These should be realistic and celebrate your progress along the way.

### Exercise: Financial Milestones

**6-Month Milestones:**
- [ ] Complete financial assessment
- [ ] Establish savings accounts
- [ ] Save first $1,000
- [ ] Create and stick to monthly budget
- [ ] Other: _________________________________

**12-Month Milestones:**
- [ ] Save $5,000
- [ ] Land fund at 25% of goal
- [ ] Emergency fund established
- [ ] Debt reduced by: $__________
- [ ] Other: _________________________________

**18-Month Milestones:**
- [ ] Land fund at 50% of goal
- [ ] Infrastructure fund started
- [ ] Ready for land purchase (if timeline allows)
- [ ] Other: _________________________________

Celebrate these milestones. They represent real progress toward your goal.

## Common Financial Concerns

Let me address some common concerns people have:

**"I don't have enough money."**
Many people start with less than they think they need. You can start small and build over time. You don't need everything at once.

**"I have too much debt."**
Debt doesn't have to stop you. Create a plan to manage it while you save. It might take longer, but it's still possible.

**"I don't know if I can save enough."**
Start with what you can save. Even small amounts add up. And remember: you can adjust your timeline or your goals as needed.

**"What if something goes wrong?"**
That's why we build an emergency fund first. Having a safety net gives you confidence to move forward.

## Your Financial Action Plan

Now let's create your action plan. Based on everything we've discussed, what are your next steps?

### Exercise: Financial Action Plan

**This Month:**
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

**Next 3 Months:**
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

**Next 6 Months:**
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

Be specific. "Save money" is vague. "Save $200 per month" is specific and actionable.

## Moving Forward

You've done important work here. You've looked at your financial situation honestly, set realistic goals, and created a plan. That's a solid foundation.

Remember: financial planning isn't about perfection. It's about clarity and progress. You don't need to have everything figured out perfectly. You just need to know enough to take the next step.

Your financial situation will evolve. Your goals might change. Your timeline might adjust. That's all okay. The important thing is that you're moving forward with awareness and intention.

In the next chapter, we'll talk about finding the right land. But before you move on, take a moment to appreciate what you've accomplished. You've faced a topic that many people avoid, and you've created a plan. That's worth celebrating.
