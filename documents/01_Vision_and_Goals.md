# Chapter 1: Vision and Goals

## Why Vision Matters

Before we dive into the practical details—the budgets, the land searches, the infrastructure plans—let's talk about something that many people skip over: your vision. It might seem like a luxury when there are so many concrete things to figure out, but having a clear vision is like having a compass. When you're faced with decisions you never expected (and you will be), your vision helps you know which way to go.

I've seen people jump straight into looking at properties or calculating costs without really understanding what they're trying to create. They end up with land that doesn't fit their lifestyle, or they build systems they don't actually need, or they burn out because they're working toward someone else's idea of homesteading instead of their own.

Your vision is personal. It's not about what you think you *should* want or what looks good on Instagram. It's about what actually matters to you, what makes you feel alive, and what kind of life you want to wake up to every day.

## Starting with Feelings, Not Facts

Here's something that might surprise you: we're going to start with feelings, not facts. Before we talk about acreage or solar panels or chicken coops, let's explore what you're really seeking.

Take a moment and think about this: What does a perfect day on your future homestead look like? Don't worry about whether it's realistic yet—we're exploring possibilities. Close your eyes if it helps.

Are you waking up to the sound of roosters or complete silence? Are you starting your day with coffee on a porch watching the sunrise, or are you already out in the garden? What are you doing in the morning? The afternoon? How do you feel at the end of the day—tired but satisfied, or energized and accomplished?

Now, let's dig deeper. Why does this vision matter to you? What's missing from your current life that this would provide?

### Reflection Exercise: Your Perfect Day

Take 10-15 minutes and write about your perfect day on your homestead. Don't edit yourself or worry about logistics. Just write. Describe it in detail—the sights, sounds, smells, feelings. What are you doing? Who's with you? How do you feel?

When you're done, read it back. What stands out to you? What themes emerge? These aren't random details—they're clues about what you're really seeking.

## Understanding Your "Why"

Your "why" is the foundation everything else builds on. When things get hard (and they will), your "why" is what keeps you going. When you have to make difficult choices, your "why" helps you choose.

But here's the thing: your "why" might not be obvious at first. It might take some digging to uncover it. That's okay. Let's explore it together.

### Exercise: Exploring Your Why

I'm going to ask you a series of questions. Don't rush through them. Really think about each one. There are no right or wrong answers—just your answers.

**Question 1:** What drew you to homesteading in the first place? Was it a specific moment, a gradual realization, or something else?
Answer: I lived in a few different places throughout the USincluding travelingcountry for a few yearshave lived in both suburban and metropolitan citiesspecifically in the Phoenix Valley for the lastnearly 20 years and part of Maine is just tired of thecity and it feels likethere's not a lotpiece here I guess I'm kind of at a loss for the correct words butthere's also the idea of being in a food desertI don't care for and a lot of the economic and politicalevents occurring now has kind of brought it more to my attention.
**Question 2:** When you imagine your life on a homestead, what feeling are you seeking? Is it freedom? Security? Connection? Peace? Something else?
Answer: I think a large part of it is the self sustainabilityI've worked to no longer have any debt other than my mortgageand have been investing my moneyover the last five years in order totry to increase my net worth to potentially invest in a project like thisThe house I live in currently has never felt like it was going to be my long term home and I would much rather live in a larger piece of landand not be in the Phoenix ValleyMore than half the year it's over 100 degrees.
**Question 3:** What are you trying to move away from? What about your current life doesn't work for you?
Answer: I don't know that I necessarily feel like I'm moving away it's more the idealiving on land that I own and investing myself in is more attractive than my current situationThere's nothing to do at my house other than to fix and repair thingsFeels like I'm putting time and effort into something that I don't want to keep it's like trying to fix up an old car Oregon something that you don't really want to keep in the long run so investing the money feels even more negativeBut I would like to start investing in a long term project likeproperty and starting some homesteading
**Question 4:** What are you trying to move toward? What does your ideal life look like?
Answer: Well I have the ability to work from home 100 percent of the time so ideally I would still work remotelyjust from my propertythe huge focus isn't necessarily that I want to start some farm it's more aboutself sufficiency I would still want to live someplace close to civilization for supplies not trying tonot interact with people or society it's more of the long-term intentand working towards retirementand I've never wanted to retire here inthe Phoenix Valley.
**Question 5:** If you could only achieve one thing through homesteading, what would it be?
Answer: Self sufficiency and peace


Take your time with these. Write down your thoughts, even if they feel incomplete or messy. You can refine them later. For now, just get them out of your head and onto paper.

## Different Visions, Different Paths

Homesteading means different things to different people, and that's beautiful. There's no one "right" way to do this. Let me share a few examples of different visions I've seen:

**Sarah's Vision:** Complete self-sufficiency. She wants to grow all her food, generate all her power, and be completely independent from systems she doesn't trust. Her homestead is about freedom and security.

**Mike's Vision:** A modern homestead. He wants to grow most of his food and live closer to nature, but he also wants reliable internet for remote work and the ability to drive into town easily. His homestead is about balance.

**Jamie's Vision:** A family legacy. She wants to create a place where her children learn where food comes from, where they can run free, and where they build memories that last a lifetime. Her homestead is about connection and values.

**Alex's Vision:** A peaceful retreat. He wants a quiet place to live simply, grow some food, maybe keep a few animals, but mostly just enjoy the peace and quiet of rural life. His homestead is about simplicity and tranquility.

Which of these resonates with you? Or is your vision something entirely different? There's no judgment here—just curiosity about what you're really seeking. 

Answer: Likely a mixture between Alex and Mike's vision.

### Reflection: What's Your Vision Type?

Think about the examples above. Do any of them feel close to what you're seeking? Or is your vision a combination? Or something entirely different?

Answer: These two examples are close to the vision i had in mind.

Write a few sentences about what your vision feels like. Don't worry about making it perfect—just capture the essence of what you're trying to create.

## From Feelings to Concrete Goals

Now that we've explored the feelings and the "why," let's start translating that into something more concrete. But here's the important part: we're not going to lose the feelings. The concrete goals should serve the feelings, not replace them.

Let's think about what self-sufficiency really means to you. This is personal, and there's no right answer.

### Exercise: Defining Your Self-Sufficiency

For each area below, think about what level of self-sufficiency feels right to you. Not what you think you "should" want, but what actually feels right:

**Food Production:**
- Do you want to grow 100% of your vegetables, or is supplementing your current diet enough?
Answer: I don't know that growing 100 percent of my vegetables is truly one of the goals but it's would be something I would be interested inespecially in thebeginning I would plan on still going to grocery stores and purchasing food in the traditional way but yes I would like to have a garden of some sort currently in Arizona it's pretty hard to have an outside garden so it would be nice when I live in a place that I can do that.

- Are you interested in raising animals for meat, or just eggs and dairy?
Answer: If I did raise animals it would likely be small ones like chickens or rabbits I don't have much of an interest in large animals like cows or goats or pigs.

- Do you want to preserve food for year-round eating, or focus on fresh seasonal eating?
Answer: I think that would come further down the line once I was established I imagine the first few years is going to be a lot ofinfrastructure building and all of my time and resources would go into ensuring the landhad things that needed like potentiallysolar or electrical hookups to the citypotentially sewagea well things of that nature are much more of a higher priority.

**Energy:**
- Are you seeking complete independence from the grid, or would you prefer a hybrid approach?
Answer: 

- Is renewable energy important to you for environmental reasons, or primarily for independence?
Answer: 

- How much are you willing to adjust your lifestyle to reduce energy needs?
Answer: 


**Water:**
- Do you need complete water independence, or is having a reliable source enough?
Answer: I definitely think a well would be high on the list if there is no municipal water on the land and I know it's alarge expense but kind of a one and done expense where if I pay to get it done once I'd be able to have water for a long time.

- Are you comfortable with rainwater collection, or do you prefer a well?
Answer: I would be comfortable with either one I could see that rain collection could come before digging it well depending on the price.

- How important is water quality vs. water independence?
Answer: I don't know enough about water to be able to state whether water quality or water independence is more important the bottom line for me is to have readily available clean water so I'm not purchasing it from a store.


**Income:**
- Do you want your homestead to generate income, or is it primarily a lifestyle choice?
Answer: I think it's more of a lifestyle choice but if in the long run there was a way to make money off the land I wouldn't be against it.

- Are you planning to work remotely, or transition to full-time homesteading?
Answer: I currently work remote full time so the plan would be to continue to work from the homestead and have remote Internet.

- What's your relationship with money in this new lifestyle?
Answer: I don't quite understand this question I think my relationship with money would still be the same it's a tool in order to meet my goals.


## Your Dream List

Now let's have some fun. I want you to create a dream list—an unlimited, no-holds-barred list of everything you want on your homestead. Don't worry about feasibility, cost, or logistics. Just dream.

Think about:
- What kind of shelter do you want? A tiny home? A cabin? A traditional house? Something unique?
Answer: The first shelter I want to havewould be semi permanent in one that would hopefully eventually transition into either a guest home or maybe a workshop or something so I'm leaning towards more of Abarnuminium or maybe one of those large converted sheds or boxed cabin that I could put together myself was high on the list.

- What animals do you want? Chickens? Goats? Bees? Pigs? Just pets?
Answer: Maybe chickens in the long run.

- What do you want to grow? Vegetables? Fruits? Herbs? Flowers? Trees?
Answer: vegetables garden

- What systems do you want? Solar? Wind? Composting toilet? Greenhouse? Root cellar?
Answer: Solar power, potentially a greenhouse and/or root cellar.

- What activities do you want to do? Canning? Woodworking? Foraging? Something else?
Answer: These things are not high on the priority. The highest priority is purchasing land and living on it. the "farming" aspect of it is very secondary.

- How do you want to generate income? Selling produce? Teaching workshops? Online business? Something else?
Answer: I plan to continue to work remotely with the current company I am employed with.


### Exercise: Your Unlimited Dream List

Take 20-30 minutes and write down everything you can imagine wanting on your homestead. Organize it however makes sense to you—by category, by priority, or just as a stream of consciousness. The important thing is to get it all out of your head.

When you're done, read it back. What surprises you? What excites you most? What feels essential vs. what feels like a "nice to have"?
Answer: I think answer the questions above has fulfilled this answer.


## Setting Realistic Milestones

Okay, now we're going to bring some reality into the picture—but gently. Your dreams are valid, and we're not going to crush them. Instead, we're going to think about how to make them happen over time.

Let's think about your journey in phases:

**Year 1:** What do you want to achieve in your first year? This might include purchasing land, establishing basic infrastructure, or beginning to develop skills.
Answer: Purchase land and establish a home there that has electricity and water; also sewage of possible.

**Year 5:** Where do you want to be in five years? By this point, you'll likely have your basic systems in place and be producing some of your own food.
Answer: Living sustainibly and investing in the property and financial investments.

**Year 10:** What's your ultimate vision? This is where your dream list really comes into play.
Within 10 years I'd like to have enough money to build a permanent home with a foundation; traditional home built on the land. Or, potentially an "Earth Ship" style home.

### Exercise: Milestone Planning

For each time frame, write down 3-5 key milestones. These should be specific enough to be meaningful but flexible enough to adapt as you learn.
Answer: I don't have enough information on where the land will be purchased and what the requirements will be in order to set milestone goals.

**1-Year Milestones:**
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

**5-Year Milestones:**
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

**10-Year Vision:**
Take a few minutes and describe your homestead in 10 years. What does it look like? What are you producing? How are you living? What have you achieved?

## Identifying Your Priorities

You can't do everything at once, and that's okay. The key is knowing what matters most to you so you can focus your energy and resources where they'll have the biggest impact.

Let's think about what's truly important to you. I'm going to list some common priority areas. For each one, ask yourself: How important is this to my vision?

- Financial independence
- Food self-sufficiency
- Energy independence
- Water independence
- Quality of shelter
- Livestock
- Income generation
- Community connection
- Environmental impact
- Skills development

Rank these from 1 (most important) to 10 (least important), or however many apply to you. There's no right answer—just what matters to you.

### Exercise: Priority Reflection

After ranking your priorities, ask yourself: Why did I rank them this way? What does this tell me about what I'm really seeking?

Your top 3 priorities should guide your major decisions going forward. When you're faced with choices, ask: Which option better serves my top priorities?

## Acknowledging Obstacles

Let's be honest: this journey won't be easy. There will be obstacles. That's not pessimism—it's realism. But here's the thing: when you know what obstacles you might face, you can prepare for them.

Think about potential challenges:

**Financial:** Do you have enough saved? Will you need to work while building? How will you handle unexpected costs?

**Physical/Skills:** Do you have the skills you need? Are you physically able to do the work? What can you learn before you start?

**Life Circumstances:** Are there family considerations? Job constraints? Health concerns? Other responsibilities?

### Exercise: Obstacle Planning

Identify 2-3 potential obstacles in each category. Then, for each obstacle, think about potential solutions. You don't need to have it all figured out—just start thinking about it.

**Financial Obstacles:**
- Challenge: _________________________________
- Potential Solutions: _________________________________

**Physical/Skill Obstacles:**
- Challenge: _________________________________
- Potential Solutions: _________________________________

**Life Circumstance Obstacles:**
- Challenge: _________________________________
- Potential Solutions: _________________________________

Remember: identifying obstacles isn't about finding reasons not to do this. It's about being prepared so you can overcome them when they arise.

## Creating Your Vision Statement

Now let's bring it all together. I want you to write a vision statement—2-3 sentences that capture the essence of what you're trying to create. This isn't set in stone—you can revise it as you learn and grow—but it should capture where you're heading.

Your vision statement should answer:
- What are you creating?
- Why does it matter to you?
- What does success look like?

### Exercise: Your Vision Statement

Take some time and write your vision statement. Don't worry about making it perfect—just capture what you're trying to create.

```
[Write your vision statement here - 2-3 sentences that summarize your ultimate goal]
```

Read it back. Does it feel true to you? Does it capture what you're really seeking? If not, revise it until it does.

## Living with Your Vision

Your vision isn't something you write once and forget. It's a living thing that will evolve as you learn and grow. That's not a failure—it's growth.

I recommend revisiting your vision:
- **Monthly:** Check in with yourself. Are you still heading in the right direction?
- **Quarterly:** Revisit your dream list. What's changed? What's become clearer?
- **Annually:** Review your milestones. Are they still relevant? What have you learned?

Your vision is your compass, but it's okay if the destination shifts slightly as you learn more about yourself and what you really want.

## What's Next?

You've done important work here. You've explored your "why," defined your vision, and started thinking about how to make it real. That's a solid foundation.

In the next chapter, we're going to talk about money—specifically, how to understand your current financial situation and plan for your homestead financially. Some people find this part uncomfortable, and that's okay. We'll approach it with compassion and practicality.

But before you move on, take a moment to appreciate what you've accomplished. You've started to clarify something big and important. That's worth celebrating.

**Your Next Step:** When you're ready, turn to Chapter 2: Financial Planning. We'll help you understand your financial situation and create a plan that supports your vision.
